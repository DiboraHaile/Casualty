# Casuality
Understand and Infer the causal graph from observational data and then validate the graph.

The most interesting questions in buisness are often not answerable with observational data alone.
The causal graph is a central object in Judea Pearl framework, that attempts to solve this challenge. The casual graph, however is often unknown, subject to personal knowledge and bias, or loosely connected to the available data.
